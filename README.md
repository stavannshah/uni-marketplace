# University Student Marketplace

## Project Description  
The **University Student Marketplace** is a secure web platform built with **ReactJS** and **Golang**, exclusively for university students to buy, sell, and interact within their campus community. This platform fosters **trust and security** by verifying users through university email authentication (via OTP) and ensures exclusivity for students.  

By focusing on a **tight-knit student community**, the marketplace enables **quicker buy-and-sell transactions**, as students are constantly on the move and in need of efficient exchanges. Additionally, being part of the same community promotes **competitive pricing**, making items more affordable.  

Key features include a **buy-and-sell management system**, a **currency exchange request mechanism**, and a **user profile system** showcasing ratings, feedback, and active listings.
