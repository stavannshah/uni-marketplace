## Sprint 3 Report  

### Work Completed in Sprint 3  
1. **User ID Functionality Integration**  
   - Implemented a `userid` functionality to recognize users upon login, which allows for a seamless user experience.
   - Every API request is now personalized by requiring only the `userid`, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and improving database query efficiency.
   - Backend authentication logic was updated to ensure that only valid `userid` values are processed for user-specific operations.

2. **Item Listing Tab Implementation**  
   - Developed and connected the backend API to retrieve and display all marketplace item listings.
   - Implemented an optimized UI featuring a sleek card-based interface to enhance readability and accessibility.
   - Added a "Create Listing" button, allowing users to post new listings.
   - Any new listing is stored in the backend database and immediately reflected on the frontend without requiring a page refresh.
   - Two APIs were created to support this functionality:
     - **GET /api/user/listings**: Retrieves all listings associated with the authenticated user.
     - **POST /api/user/listing**: Enables users to create new listings, storing details such as title, description, category, price, condition, location, and images.

3. **Home Page UI Enhancements**  
   - The homepage was redesigned to prominently display "User Listings," i.e., the listings a user has created.
   - Implemented real-time updates so that any new listings appear immediately without needing to refresh the page.
   - Improved UI elements for a cleaner and more intuitive experience.
   
4. **Unit Testing for Frontend and Backend**  
   - Developed and executed unit tests to validate the robustness of both frontend and backend implementations.
   - Ensured that API responses are correctly processed and displayed on the UI.
   - Verified that user interactions (such as creating listings) work without errors and persist data correctly.

## Future Work  
1. **User Profile Functionalities**

## Backend Unit Tests  
1. **TestUserIDRecognition**  
   - Confirms that the system correctly identifies users based on `userid`.
2. **TestGetUserListingsAPI**  
   - Ensures that `GET /api/user/listings` retrieves the correct listings.
3. **TestPostUserListingAPI**
